# 🚀 Python • DSA • Machine Learning • Data Science Learning Repository

Welcome to my learning repository! 👋  
This repo documents my **hands-on journey** of mastering **Python programming**, **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**, and stepping into **Machine Learning & Data Science** with practical examples and implementations.

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository is a **learning-first, practice-driven** collection where I:
- Learn concepts from scratch
- Implement them in **Python & Java**
- Practice problem-solving
- Build a strong foundation for **Software Engineering, Data Science & AI roles**

It is continuously updated as I learn new topics.
